  ADI MAX22190 octal industrial Input with advanced diagnostic
  capabilities like Wire break and over/under volatage.
  Fiter configuration could be done on per channel bases, which
  mean WB functionality and fiters could be set.Reffering to:
  filter-wbes = <CH0 CH1 CH2 ... CH7 >  for wire break
  To ebale wire break set 1 else 0. Same principal is followed for:
  filter-fbps and filter-dealys.

      Default mode set to 1, because in MAX22190PMB devkit this is hardwired
      mode set by manifacturer.
      max22190 mode is configured from M0 and M1 pins with
      pull up or down resistors.

      Wire break functionality is enabled by default on all channels.
      WBE bit in all Filter registers stand for wire break enable on each
      channel, so to enable WB functionality set 1.
      If WB on specific channel is disabled , FAULT will not be rised in case
      wire is cut.
      - 1 wire break enable
      - 0 wire break disable
      channels indentation start from CH0...CH7

    default: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

      By default all channels are set to bypass mode from documentation.
      Enable or disable filter
      - 1 mean bypass
      - 0 mean filter is used
      channels indentation start from CH0...CH7
  filter-delays:
    type: array
    default: [20000, 20000, 20000, 20000, 20000, 20000, 20000, 20000]

      Default value in documentation is 20ms which corespond to 200000us.
      Used to setup filter delay. Values are set in uS. Default value is 20000us = 20ms
