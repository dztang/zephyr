      SD card slot
      ESP32 peripheral supports two card slots. As slot 0 pins are
      used for communication with internal SPI flash, only slot 1 is
      available for use.

      Power pin
      This is a configurable pin to deliver power supply to the SD card.
      It is configured as a GPIO in order to execute power toggles and
      reinitialize the SD slave when necessary.
