  Special no-controller device used as parent for soc-nv-flash
  devices that are only used to define flash region used during
  compilation to define application placement in NV-memory.
  soc-nv-flash nodes hanging from such controller may not be
  accessed, using flash_api, at run-time but can still be evaluated
  at compile time using DT macros.

compatible: "zephyr,null-controller"

include: base.yaml
