description: |
  MIPI-DBI Mode A compatible parallel controller. This driver emulates
  MIPI-DBI mode A (known as Intel 8080 mode) using GPIO pins

compatible: "zephyr,mipi-dbi-intel8080"

include: base.yaml

bus: mipi-dbi

properties:
  rd-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      RD strobe. Active low.

  wr-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Wr strobe.
      Active low. On low to high transition, device will
      latch data pins

  dc-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Data/Command gpio pin. Set to low when sending a command,
      or high when sending data

  cs-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      CS pin
      Active low.
      When high RD, WR, DC/RS are ignored

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Reset GPIO pin. Set high to reset display

  data-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Data pins

  write-only:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Only writes to display controller, do not perform reads.
      If all controllers are write-only, read functions will be
      optimized out for size.
      It can also be used as an alternative to half duplex when
      only one data line is connected.
